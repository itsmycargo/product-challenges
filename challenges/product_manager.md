# Product Manager

As part of the product team, one of biggest responsibilities as Product Manager is to gather requirements and plan new
features. In this challenge we would like you to take any of your favourite product or service and design a new feature
you think it is currently missing, and needs.

What we expect is a short presentation where you describe what the new feature is, why is would make a difference for product/service or its customers and how you came to conclusion
