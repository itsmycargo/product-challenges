# Product Manager

As part of the product team, one of the biggest responsibilities as a Product Manager is to gather requirements and plan new
features. In this challenge we would like you to take any of your favourite products or services and design a new feature, that you think is currently missing, and define the business case around it.

What we expect is a short presentation where you describe what the new feature is, why it would make a difference for the product/service or its customers and how you came to the conclusion.
