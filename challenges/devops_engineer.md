# DevOps Challenge

We like to thank you for taking part in our technical challenge. What we would like to see from you with this challenge
is your way to think and solve problems and research solutions. We care more about how you get to a solution than the actual
solution itself. If you encounter any difficulties or get stuck, don’t worry. Just send us back what you have managed to
complete.

## Challenge

The task is simple: deploy a simple web service with an Nginx reverse proxy in front of it to a Kubernetes managed cloud environment.
You can use any web service you like. As an example, the dockercloud/hello-world image works well.
For the Kubernetes cluster, you can use anything that you already have access to, or easily launch a test cluster. For example, on macOS you can install Docker for Mac and then enable a local Kubernetes cluster from the settings.

What we want to see from you, is that you are able to explain how you deployed the services and, if you had any challenges, how
you found answers for the problems, as well as service descriptions you used to deploy the services to Kubernetes.

Best of luck, and if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact us!
