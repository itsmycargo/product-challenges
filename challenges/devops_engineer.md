# DevOps Challenge

We like to thank you for taking part of our technical challenge. What we would like to see from you with this challenge
is Your way to think and solve problem and research solutions, we care more of how you get solution than actual
solution. If you encounter any difficulties or get stuck, don’t worry. Just sent us back what you have managed to
complete.

## Challenge

Task is simple, deploy simple web service with Nginx reverse proxy in front of it to Kubernetes cloud.
You can use any web service you like, but for example dockercloud/hello-world image works well.
For Kubernetes cluster, you can use anything that you already have access, or launch test cluster easily. For example
for Macs you can install Docker for Mac and then enable local Kubernetes cluster from settings.

What we want to see from you is to you able to explain how you deployed services and, if you had any challenges, how
you found answers for the problems as well service descriptions you used to deploy services to Kubernetes.

Best luck, and if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact.
