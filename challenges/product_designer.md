## Product Designer

As a part of the design and product team, one of your challenges will be to display freight quotations to the customers.
So, for this challenge we would like you to conceptualise and prototype a quote listing page.

You should surface the information you think is most important to help the user decide which quotation and shipment
option they would like to choose.

Freight quotations naturally of the price, but also different mode of transport (air/ocean) and transit times.

While you’ll only be designing one page, please consider how it works in the grand scheme of things, i.e., the
information architecture, navigation, and cross device support.

We’re not looking for the best possible solution; instead we’re looking for an insight into your process. We’d love to see every stage (sketches, brainstorms, wireframes etc. are all great), all the way up to a design in the fidelity you deem appropriate for this type of project. Bonus points if you include some form of interactive prototype.

There's no set time limit as we care more about the design output than how short or long it took to create. Getting it back to us in a week is good.

We'll take a look at your designs and get back to you with feedback within a few days. That's it!

Good luck.
